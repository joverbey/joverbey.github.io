## About Me - Jeffrey L. Overbey, Ph.D.

I am a senior software engineer/compiler engineer in the MATLAB Language Analysis, Transformation, and Design team at [MathWorks](http://www.mathworks.com/), where I get to spend all day working on fun compiler stuff with an amazing team of talented software engineers.

In the open source world, I work on the [Go Doctor](http://gorefactor.org), a refactoring tool for [Golang](https://golang.org/), as well as [Photran](http://www.eclipse.org/photran) and [PTP](http://www.eclipse.org/ptp), which provide [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) plug-ins for Fortran and high-performance computing.

In a previous life, I spent a couple of years as an assistant professor at Auburn University.  My [research](http://jeff.over.bz/papers/) focused on refactoring tools and GPU programming.  I taught Algorithms, Assembly Language, Automata Theory/Formal Languages, GPU Programming, Operating Systems, Reverse Engineering, and Programming Language Semantics & Static Analysis.

I received my PhD from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/), where I worked on refactoring tools under the direction of [Ralph Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Johnson_(computer_scientist)).  For my master's degree, I studied parsing theory under [M.&nbsp;Dennis Mickunas](https://doi.org/10.1145/321958.321972).  Before that, I double-majored in computer science and applied mathematics at [Southeast Missouri State University](http://www.semo.edu/).
